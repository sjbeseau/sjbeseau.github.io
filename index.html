          <p class="title is-3">Project Design</p>
          <p class="has-text-left">My example of project design is part of a group guided by Chris Bachman from the Lands Council. Our goal was to look at potential solutions for tensions that exist between cattle farmers in Washington 
	  State and the reintroduction of wolf populations. This ended up being a very aggressive goal beyond our available resources, so we decided to redirect the project to look at one aspect of the problem. We looked at 
	  the interaction between wolf depredations on cattle and their locations as juxtaposed to landcover and roads. A map of my section of the project is visible below. As seen on this map, a large part of the depredations occurred in 
	  forested areas near active DNR roads. My map would eventually be combined with 5 others that were part of this group project. The methods we used to be sure out separate projects would align into a single map are described below.</p>

          <p>Data Input</p>
          <p class="has-text-left">This project required the digitizing of point, line, and polygon layers. My portion of the project can be seen in the adjacent Landcover and Unmarked Roads map. One of the challenges when individually digitizing objects that will later be merged with the work of other group members 
	  is alignment of the finished products. Each of the six group members had shared boundaries that needed to line up without overlaps or gaps. To achieve this, we created a feature dataset with a predefined projection and a 
	  polygon boundary for each of our required areas. The feature dataset was then copied and sent to each of the group members using a file sharing dropbox. Once our individual feature classes were created, we then combined 
	  all layers on a single computer to make sure they lined up, and used topology rules to confirm this.</p>

          <p>Coordinate Systems</p>
          <p class="has-text-left">As can be seen in the adjacent Feature Dataset Properties image, the coordinate system used for this project was NAD_1983_HARN_StatePlane Washington_North_FIPS_4601_Feet. The advantage of using a 
	  feature dataset is that the projection is set when it is created, so any feature classes created or brought into it will be in that projection. Using layers with different coordinate systems may lead to misalignments, 
	  so it is a good idea to decide on an appropriate projection at the beginning of a project and stick to it until completion.</p>

          <p>Metadata</p>
          <p class="has-text-left">Data about the various layers in a map project is called metadata. A common industry standard is Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) compliant metadata. This metadata should include 
	  source information, a description of the layer and it purpose, projection information, scale, author, and contact information at minimum.</p>

          <p></p>
          <p class="has-text-left">This <u><a href="assets/DataAnalysis.pdf" target="_blank">link</a></u> navigates to a pdf version of my data analysis for crime statistics in Spokane, WA. The pdf describes methodology used to generate the maps and information sources used. Maps used in the crime analysis are available for quick viewing below, or higher resolution map versions are embedded in the pdf for a more detailed look.</p>
          <p class="has-text-left">The program used for this analysis is ESRI's new ArcGIS PRO. This program continues the trend of software suites, like Adobe, toward an always online approach based on cloud computing. 
	  The three maps below illustrate a heat map analysis using ArcGIS PRO. The basemap in this software by default generates a topographic map. Using this map as a starting point, I layered boundary and point data for the 
	  City of Spokane that was retrieved from Open Spokane Data. Contrary to the older method required in ArcMap where the point density spatial analysis tool is used to generate a heat map, ArcGIS PRO simply requires the application
	  of a heat map symbology. While both of these methods are effective, the new method is more efficient.</p>

          <p class="title is-3">Map Design</p>
          <p class="has-text-left">The map below of Directions to Eastern Washington Univeristy was generated with ArcMap and shows elements important to good map design basics, including: title, legend, north arrow, map scale, source(s), author, and date.
          More complex elements include considerations such as visual balance, visual hierarchy, hue(s), contrast, and symbology. It is important to choose elements that improve readability and understanding of a map, and to not leave out
          map elements that may be important for identifying where a map came from and how it was generated. Minute preferences, such as the extra space between the map and neatline below, may provide enhanced readability where
          confusion between roads and map edges occur.</p>
          <p class="has-text-left">While programs like ArcMap do a great job at visualizing data taken from tables, these programs often fall short in creating effective design layouts. In this particular map, the symbology and drop
	  shadows were added by exporting the ArcMap file to either a .pdf or .ai file type in order to allow editing in Adobe Illustrator. Since Illustrator is built from the ground up as a graphic design tool, it can more effectively
	  contribute to good design practices and an overall better finished product. The feathered shadow seen in my example below makes the inset map stand out; the process of creating a feathered shadow in Illustrator can be done
	  with a simple selection and application of the shadow, whereas achieving a feathered shadows in ArcMap is a complex and time consuming process.</p>

	  utilizing ESRI's ArcGIS Online, and was created as part of a group project for GEOG 427 Desktop Mapping to analyze hazard spill risks in Spokane County, WA. My specific contributions to this project include the Spokane 
	  & Spokane Valley Spill Buffer Zones map (visible below), color schema and appropriate legend elements, and layout for the map journal based on group and professor recommendations.</p>
          <p class="has-text-left">ArcGIS Online is cloud-computing software that allows for the easy sharing of maps and data. This information can be made available to the public or kept private if the work is sensitive or still in 
	  progress. ArcGIS Online is also compatible with other mapping software. For example, many of the layers created in the Spill Buffer Zones map below were first created in ArcMap. The created layers were then uploaded to 
	  our group ArcGIS Online storage area. The uploaded files were then available for use by anyone in the group. This improves the divisibility of labor, where one group member concentrates on polyline information such 
	  as roads, while another group member can digitize point locations such as hospitals or fire stations. The information is then available to everyone via ArcGIS Online. A downside to ArcGIS Online is the upfront
	  expense for licensing, but the expense can be largely offset through productivity. For a deeper look at what ArcGIS Online is capable of, visit the ESRI link <u><a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-agol.htm" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</p>
